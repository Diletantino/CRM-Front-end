[EspoCRM](https://www.espocrm.com) is a free, open-source CRM platform designed to help organizations build and maintain strong customer relationships.
It provides a wide range of tools to store, organize, and manage leads, contacts, sales opportunities, marketing campaigns,
support cases, and more – all business information in a simple and intuitive interface.

### Architecture

EspoCRM is a web application with a frontend designed as a single-page application and a REST API
backend written in PHP.

### Demo

You can try the CRM on an online [demo](https://www.espocrm.com/demo/).

### Requirements

* PHP 8.3 - 8.5;
* MySQL 8.0 (and later), or MariaDB 10.6 (and later);
* PostgreSQL 15 (and later).

For more information about server configuration, see [this article](https://docs.espocrm.com/administration/server-configuration/).

### Download

[Download](https://www.espocrm.com/download/) the latest release from our website or from GitHub [releases](https://github.com/espocrm/espocrm/releases).

### Release notes

Release notes are available at GitHub [releases](https://github.com/espocrm/espocrm/releases).

### Documentation

See the [documentation](https://docs.espocrm.com) for administrators, users and developers.

### Why EspoCRM?

* Open-source transparency. EspoCRM's source code is open and accessible, so anyone can inspect it and see how data is being managed within the CRM.
* Customization freedom. You can develop features, create custom entities, fields, relationships, buttons to make the system fit your specific needs. EspoCRM is more than a CRM – it's a platform for building custom business applications.
* Clean user interface. EspoCRM offers an uncluttered, minimalist, and fast user interface, which is easy to navigate and has a short learning curve.
* Straightforward REST API. It can be easily integrated with other applications using a REST API.

### Who is EspoCRM for?

* From startups, small & medium-sized businesses to larger organizations. A flexible, fully customizable solution that scales with your needs.
* Developers & tech enthusiasts. You can extend functionalities, build extensions, and create custom integrations.
* Anyone seeking a free or on-premise CRM.

### Development

See the [developer documentation](https://docs.espocrm.com/development/).

#### Run the complete CRM with Docker

The runtime stack contains MariaDB, the EspoCRM web application, the background
daemon and the WebSocket service. The Studio Management backend and frontend
are baked into the local image and refreshed in the persistent custom volumes
each time the web container starts.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, replace all three example passwords, and set
   `CRM_ADMIN_HOSTS` plus `CRM_ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS`.
2. Start the stack:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

3. Wait until the application is healthy, then open a host allowed by
   `CRM_ADMIN_HOSTS` from an address allowed by `CRM_ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS` and
   sign in with `CRM_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `CRM_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from `.env`.

Regular users cannot use the standard login page. A Registration Link opens
registration on first use and becomes the same user's account-bound login page
after registration. The secret is carried in a URL fragment (`#access=...`),
which is not sent in an HTTP request or Referer header, and is removed from the
address bar immediately. The user must still enter their password. One link
cannot be used to authenticate another account.

For production, copy `.env.production.example` to `.env`, replace every
`GENERATE_...` / `CHANGE_ME_...` value, create an A/AAAA record for the
administrator hostname (for example `wesperr.studio`), and enforce HTTPS. An
MX record is only for mail and does not control web access. Keep real passwords
and IP addresses in the untracked `.env` file or in the deployment platform's
secret storage.

The Compose file binds CRM ports to `127.0.0.1` by default. Put a trusted HTTPS
reverse proxy on the same server in front of them. The proxy must overwrite
`X-Real-IP`, pass the original `Host`, support WebSocket upgrades, and rate-limit
at least `/api/v1/StudioManagement/invitation`,
`/api/v1/StudioManagement/register`, and `/api/v1/App/user`. Do not expose ports
8080/8081 directly when `CRM_IP_ADDRESS_SERVER_PARAM=HTTP_X_REAL_IP`, because a
direct client could otherwise spoof that header.

Before the first production start, back up the database and persistent volumes.
After deployment, verify HTTPS, the administrator host/IP restriction, a new
registration link, logout and repeat login through that link. Existing links
are automatically migrated from `?token=...` to `#access=...` when the CRM
container starts.

Useful commands:

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f crm
docker compose down
```

`docker compose down` preserves the database and uploaded files. Removing the
named volumes also removes all CRM data, so do that only when a clean install
is intended.

#### Reproducible Linux build

The full EspoCRM build requires Node.js, PHP, Composer, PHP extensions, and
Unix utilities. A dedicated build-only Docker environment is included so the
same toolchain can be used on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It does not define or
change any runtime CRM containers.

From PowerShell run:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-linux.ps1
```

From a Unix shell run:

```bash
bash ./scripts/build-linux.sh
```

The first run downloads the toolchain and dependency caches. The resulting
EspoCRM distribution is written to the repository's `build` directory. To
clear only the build dependency caches, run
`docker compose -f compose.build.yaml down --volumes`.

We highly recommend using an IDE for development. The backend codebase adheres to SOLID principles, utilizes interfaces, static typing and generics. We recommend to start learning EspoCRM from the Dependency Injection article in the documentation.

Metadata plays an integral role in the EspoCRM application. All possible parameters are described with a JSON Schema, meaning you will have autocompletion in the IDE. You can also find the full metadata reference in the documentation.

The frontend is an SPA built on a custom framework. It utilizes nested views and service DI, with the core partially written in TypeScript. Developers primarily work with existing form and field view implementations.
